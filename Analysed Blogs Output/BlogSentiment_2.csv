1,2,"My last few hours of sleep were interrupted by aching legs. I got up to walk, stretch, massage, tried all kinds of sleeping positions, including me lying flat with legs elevated, but nothing gave relief. I noticed it was more bearable whilst walking. I’ve been doing dance class and some stretches, and I was never staying stationary for too long, but it was still barely walking. So, I got up, made some breakfast, took my multivitamin with some water, brushed my teeth, and initiated my skincare routine. There’s a step in my skincare routine that requires leaving a product on for 30 minutes, so I took this time to do 15 minutes of cleaning and 15 minutes of walking meditation.",-0.8037
2,3,"I opened up the Simple Habit app (I can give you a link to download it, and if you ever opt to upgrade to premium, we both get some free premium time — not a sponsorship, just a generic referral code!) and saw a suggested series called ‘Manage Change’ by one Andy Hobson. It was a simple meditation, intended for seating I think, but due to my leg situation I opted to do it whilst walking in a small loop around the apartment. It started off with a general body scan, awareness of breath, the usual, and moved on to some great lake imagery. A lake of your choosing, and Andy would guide you through different times of day and weathers that the lake would face, including a harsh storm followed by a still night and foggy morning. He would remind you that whatever was happening on the surface, the bottom of the lake remained still. I imagined myself on the surface, and another version of me at the bottom of the lake, observing, and reassuring me throughout the storm and enjoying the sunrise with me afterwards.",0.9245
3,4,"I am reminded that previously my goal was simply to be where I am now, regardless of other circumstances. I felt relieved of the pressures I was applying to myself in the past two days, regarding filling my time with freelance work and pursuing paid work that wouldn’t even be enjoyable to me but might lead to a longer term visa and such. But that is not why I came here. Whilst it’s good in many ways that my brain can’t let me forget of the big overarching plans in terms of building my life up, this is a year that has been semi-written off due to the pandemic anyway. This year here is just a bonus. It wasn’t part of the overarching plan. It was just a way to get extra time here to learn the language in an immersed environment, and casually seek opportunities to help speed along the overarching plan whilst generally surviving and experiencing. I don’t want to lose sight of that in the pursuit of climbing an irrelevant ladder to improve my financial situation. I need to try to keep seeing this as one isolated year, and live as such. Participate in life as much as possible, and be ready for any opportunities that may arise that truly reflect where I want to go.",0.9842
4,5,"So, 12 more days. 12 more days of healthy routine, basic life admin, exercise, study. Hopefully 12 evenings of actually relaxing and winding down with some KTV or clutching a hot drink all wrapped-up on my Itaewon rooftop instead of going down career rabbit-holes. 12 more days of priming myself inside and out, and planning for ONE YEAR AND ONE YEAR ONLY! Fighting!",0.7874
