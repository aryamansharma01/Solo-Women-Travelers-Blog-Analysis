1,2,"I ventured out on a long hike through some dense woods despite warnings that the area can be tricky, and even expert hikers often get turned around. I figured my decent sense of direction along with all those Pilates classes I had taken back at home would be enough to sufficiently prepare me. Ha.",0.3995

I got the sense that I had just stumbled upon my antidote. In a world that feels constantly wrong, everything about where I was felt exactly as it should be.",-0.4404

10,11,"Omg, what if it’s a bear?! I tried to mentally run through what I thought I’d read somewhere about what to do in case of a bear encounter, but I suddenly couldn’t remember anything. Was I supposed to play dead or yell at it? And which tactic is for brown bears and which is for black bears? What kind of bears live here anyway? How long until somebody comes across my mutilated carcass? And what will my poor mother say?!",-0.8896
