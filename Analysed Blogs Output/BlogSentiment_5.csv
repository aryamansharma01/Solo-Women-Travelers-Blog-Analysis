1,2,In November 2020 I booked to a short trip to Istanbul — somewhere I had wanted to visit for many years. I was visiting Baku and the cheapest way to fly to Baku was to fly to Istanbul first.,0.0
2,3,"H ere is my review of how I travelled, what I did and where I stayed, alongwith what it is like to visit Istanbul as a single female traveller.",0.3612
3,4,I booked my outward and return flights with British Airways from Inverness to Istanbul.,0.0
4,5,I booked them about 5 or 6 months in advance. In that time period British Airways cancelled the return leg of the flight from Istanbul to London as they stopped operating that flight.,-0.4404
5,6,"They were unwilling to rebook me onto another flight to Kiev as they said they could only rebook to my original destination. As such I got refunded, which took many months, and I then booked my own flights from Istanbul to Kiev, then Kiev to Riga. I stayed one night in Riga and then flew home to London. The change in flights added about £150 to the cost of my trip.",0.3182
6,7,Flying from Inverness to Istanbul with British Airways meant that my luggage was checked through all the way from Inverness which was helpful. As always Inverness Airport was nice and friendly and I enjoyed visiting the lounge before I flew.,0.9022
7,8,The British Airways flight landed at Heathrow Terminal 5 which is a nice new terminal with nice facilities. There was plenty of time for me to enjoy a Wagamama Vegatsu Curry before heading to join my flight to Istanbul.,0.875
8,9,The British Airways flight to Istanbul was full and as always I had pre-booked an aisle seat. In the middle seat was a man who was travelling with a colleague who was across the aisle from me.,0.0
9,10,"The man next to me then tried to persuade me to move seats, I told him I didn’t want to move seats as I always book and aisle seat. He was not happy about that. I put my headphones in for take off as normal but could hear the man and his colleague saying how silly it was that I wouldn’t move and they proceeded to lean over and talk across me.",-0.1776
10,11,When the seatbelt sign went off I got up to speak to the crew and asked if I could move. They found me a new aisle seat next to a lovely Indian couple. I moved but after a few minutes the crew asked me to move again. It turned out they had gone back to speak to the man and he was rude to them so they upgraded me to business class.,-0.3818
11,12,I then spent a very lovely 3 hours or so enjoying a nice meal and drinks in a big comfy seat. It was a pleasant surprise after being made to feel so uncomfortable by the man and his colleague.,0.927
12,13,"I flew in to the new Istanbul Airport which is absolutely massive. It was very quiet at the airport partly because it wasn’t at capacity, and partly because it was still being finished.",0.0
13,14,"It was a very long walk to get through passport control and security to the main hall but I enjoyed the walk after sitting on the plane. The passport check was quite quick, despite getting stuck behind a family who had some issues with their passports.",0.8053
14,15,Everything was straightforward and I emerged into the main arrivals hall quickly.,0.0
15,16,Getting from Istanbul Airport to Taksim Square,0.0
16,17,"Firstly when I arrived at Istanbul airport I followed the signs for the ‘Transportation’ level which is downstairs. This is where the buses, taxis etc go from and it is very clearly signed. I used the ticket machine to get an Istanbul Kart. This is not an Istanbul tourist pass but a transportation card which allows ticketless travel on the buses.",0.2492
17,18,There is a Kart machine on the transportation level to buy the card. You pay for the card itself which is about 7 or 8 Turkish Lira (about 90p). You can then add credit to the card at the same time so if you put in a 20 Lira note you would have 12 lira credit on your card if it cost 8 lira.,0.5859
18,19,"It took a little bit of working out to get through the steps in the machine, it was a bit like a brain training challenge but I got there in the end. You then swipe your card over the ticket machine when you enter the bus to pay for your fare.",0.0772
19,20,I took the IST19 Havaist shuttle bus from the transportation level to Taksim Square. It cost 18 Turkish Lira (approx £2.50) which I had already put on my card. The luggage was loaded and I was given a receipt.,0.0
20,21,The bus was quite busy and it had free wifi but I couldn’t connect as it said you needed a Turkish phone number. It took about 1 hour and 20 minutes to get to Taksim and dropped off at a small side street right beside Taksim Square.,0.3818
21,22,"I t was much cheaper than a car transfer and I then just had a short walk through Taksim to my accommodation, the Suitel Bosphorus Taksim.",0.0
22,23,There is a tram line planned from Istanbul airport to the city but it has not been completed as of November 2019 so buses or cars seemed to be the only option.,0.0
23,24,Taksim Square,0.0
24,25,The bus dropped off at the corner of Taksim Square by a hotel. The square is large and there was a huge mosque being built in one corner. By the time I arrived it was dark and the square was busy with an antiques fair and lots of people walking about. I felt fairly comfortable walking to my hotel but I did get a few looks from men.,0.5346
25,26,"Rooms at the back of the hotel would be lovely, with great views. Rooms on the main road side of the hotel are noisy with views of a sex shop.",0.802
26,27,"I booked a stay at the Suitel Bosphorus for 4 nights in late October 2019/early November 2019. It was my first visit to Istanbul, a city I had wanted to visit for a long time.",0.0

28,29,Hotel Review — Things I Liked,0.4215
29,30,Hotel Review — Things I Liked Less,0.4215
30,31,I had planned a number of visits during my stay in Istanbul but because I found sleeping so difficult at the hotel I didn’t make it out of bed very early in the morning.,-0.6384
31,32,"Day 2 Seeing Local Life, Visiting the Haggia Sophia & Walking Back Getting Around Istanbul on the Metro",0.0
32,33,"I also didn’t feel comfortable being out after dark, except close to the hotel so this meant I only had about 6 or 7 hours to explore each day.",0.5106
33,34,I took the Metro from Taksim Square to Sultanhamet which took a bit of working out. There was a connection which involved going from the Metro to an overland line which ran down to Sultanhamet Square. The metro was very noisy and the tram was very crowded so I was quite glad to get off into the fresh air of the square.,0.5945
34,35,One of the stations I used was the University stop. This was extremely busy and involved taking a lift which I absolutely hated because it was so busy.,-0.7713
35,36,A young girl let me get on the lift but the lift was overweight. The young men in the lift shouted at her and made her get out. It made me feel really uncomfortable and actually I wish I had stepped off the lift too but for some reason I didn’t feel able to do that. It was a brief and unpleasant insight into what daily life must be like for girls and women in Istanbul.,-0.664
36,37,I decided to book a guided tour to the Haggia Sophia — partly because it saved the need to queue but also so I could get an introduction into the history of the place. I booked the tour on the Tiqets app on my phone which was with the Big Bus Company and then met the guide by the big bus near the square.,0.1945
37,38,There was a quick security check before going into Haggia Sophia and there we got an overview of the building from the guide. The information was relevant and interesting and it was a good way to get more information on the highlights.,0.7906
38,39,At the end of the tour we were free to explore on our own. There is a lovely gallery area which you can reach by walking up a series of ramps. This gives a great view down into the main area of the Haggia Sophia.,0.9062
39,40,There is some beautiful detail in the building at that level and some great views of the stained glass windows.,0.8402
40,41,"I decided to enjoy a cup of tea sitting beside the Haggia Sophia. There is a small cafe, bookshop and toilets beside the main complex. It was nice to sit and people watch for a little while.",0.7184
41,42,I especially enjoyed watching a Tour Manager try to locate some American guests that had got lost in the complex and was glad I wasn’t having to do the same thing!,0.6793
42,43,Basilica Cistern,0.0
43,44,The Haggia Sophia is not a mosque so there is no need to wear a head covering — it is now a museum.,-0.3535
44,45,Returning to Taksim Square,0.0
45,46,"I had looked at visited the Basilica Cistern as it looked pretty stunning. This is located very close to the Haggia Sophia on the inside of the bend in the road. There is a small building that is the entrance. However, the queues were really long so I didn’t go in after all.",0.7003
46,47,"After exploring the area a bit more I decided to get the tram back to Taksim but every tram from Sultanhamet was full. I decided to walk back to the underground Metro station. On the way back I passed the Grand Bazaar and although I was keen to go in I didn’t feel comfortable enough going in on my own, so I will visit it another time probably with a guide.",0.9136
47,48,"Day 3 Bosphorus Breakfast, A Beautiful Palace, A Boat Ride & A Funicular Finish Dolmabahce Palace",0.5994
48,49,The walk back to the tram station was probably about 45 minutes to an hour and it was a great way to see a bit more of local life.,0.6249
49,50,I decided to visit Dolmabahce Palace as it was close to the hotel so I could walk to it. Walking down to it wasn’t that easy and several men approached me on the way. I have no idea what they said but it was a little unnerving.,0.09
50,51,Before going into the Palace I had breakfast at a cafe which looked right over the Bosphorus. It was lovely to have some toast and coffee watching the boats shuttle backwards and forwards. It was a lovely warm and sunny day and I finally felt like I was enjoying my visit to Istanbul.,0.9531
51,52,The cafe was located at the rear of a car park just by a roundabout. I had a table right by the waters edge. The waiter was very friendly and helpful and spoke English which was good too. I got a receipt and then paid at the cash desk on the way out.,0.8576
52,53,The Dolmabahce Palace was a really interesting visit. I bought a ticket for the Palace and the Harem.,0.4576
53,54,"Included in the entrance ticket, but overlooked by many, was the fact that an audio guide was included. This was collected from a little office inside the main entrance. A deposit was needed which could be cash or your passport.",-0.0387
54,55,"I chose cash preferrring to keep my passport on me. The audio guide was fantastic and packed with really interesting information about all aspects of life in the palace, alongwith the more traditional information about where things came from. (The chandeliers which are stunning came from the UK!).",0.8585
55,56,The palace is ornate and it felt a bit overwhelming by the end of the tour — the fact that so few people had so much wealth and lived such an opulent lifestyle. I felt this particularly after visiting the harem and learning about the hierarchy and structures.,0.539
56,57,"There was a cute little gift shop at the exit of the main palace, before the harem part of the visit and I got a cool little mouse mat that is like a Turkish carpet. No doubt made in China but it was fun.",0.8076
57,58,The cafe in the grounds of the palace wasn’t open so after exiting the palace I headed for the cafeteria which was just by the edge of the sea and before you exited the main gates. It was very busy and the service was a little chaotic but it was nice to sit under the trees and enjoy the view.,0.7933
58,59,I was delighted to be able to enjoy a Sherbet — a very sweet non alcoholic drink that I had heard about but never tried.,0.6593
59,60,Super Cheap Ferry Ride,0.5994
60,61,After my visit I decided to take a different route back to the hotel and walked along the shore to the ferry terminal. I made up my mind I would take a ferry across the Bosphorus Strait and come back again.,0.0
61,62,There was a ferry that ran across the strait from Kabatas which was a 10 minute walk or so along from the Palace.,0.0
62,63,I bought a return ticket and it was something like a £1 and boarded quite an old ferry and sat back and enjoyed the view and the fresh breeze.,0.7964
63,64,Fun Funicular Ride,0.5106
64,65,"On each trip there was a guy selling refreshments which was interesting, he had a tray full of goods which he carried round the ferry, although unfortunately no one seemed to be buying anything.",-0.2263
65,66,I then took the funicular from the shore up to Taksim Square. It was clean and I could use my metro card to pay for the fare so it was very cheap. I particularly loved the sign that said no ‘mansplaining’!,0.7049
66,67,"After returning to the square I decided to head for Burger King, not because I particularly like Burger King but because it has a lovely terrace with a great view over the square. After a bit of a mix up when I was ordering I headed up the tiny set of stairs to the terrace and enjoyed a great spot of people watching.",0.9729
67,68,"Day 4 The Best Breakfast, Getting Intimate with a Stranger & Another Airport Yigit Soframe Gozlem Beautiful Breakfast",0.8442
68,69,I then had a wander around the local area exploring the shops before heading back before it got too late.,0.0
69,70,I decided to make my way over to the area of the Aga Hamami Baths to make sure I could find it and then have breakfast nearby. Having eventually found the baths I decided to head to a little coffee bar for breakfast nearby. Oh my goodness it was amazing.,0.8442
70,71,It was called Yigit Soframe Gozlem and I had the most amazing breakfast spread.,0.624
71,72,"Eggs, jam, breads, coffee, fruits, nuts and more all served in cute little dishes. I was able to enjoy a soya coffee as the waiter spoke better English than me and I enjoyed sitting watching local life happen nearby. There was an antique shop across the road that was just opening up.",0.8779
72,73,This little cafe was one of the highlights of my visit — not just because the food was great but because I felt I had finally experienced the Istanbul I was looking for.,0.3716
73,74,Interestingly there was a local guide having coffee there with an American girl and he was telling her that this was the real Istanbul — how right he was.,0.4019
74,75,"I had prebooked a visit to the oldest Turkish baths in Istanbul, the Aga Hamami. The website was very easy to use and I got a prompt confirmation back of my booking. I booked the full package including a face mask which was 300 Turkish Lire (it was about £35 pounds in total).",0.4927
75,76,The entrance to the Aga Hamami was discrete and down a short flight of steps. I had actually walked past it a couple of times and not noticed it.,0.0
76,77,"On entering the main door at the lower level there was a lovely room with little cubicles around the side, a small fountain and people in various stages of the baths process.",0.3818
77,78,The welcome at the Turkish baths was warm and friendly. I was greeted by name and paid for my experience. I was given instructions on where to get changed and given slip on slippers and a towel.,0.8481
78,79,I have to say I made a huge mistake and hadn’t taken a swimming costume and initially I made the mistake of stripping off completely so there was only a towel covering me.,-0.3612
79,80,When I got into the steam room where you spend about 30 minutes warming up everyone else was in swimming costumes so headed back upstairs and put on my undies and then went back in feeling a bit more relaxed.,0.6801
80,81,"Going up and down the very tiny and steep flight of stairs with the hotel type slippers was a little unnerving. Someone had asked if they could wear their own shoes for the stairs because he had big feet and the steps were tiny and he was told it was safer to wear the slippers, which I thought was funny.",0.6908
81,82,I was surprised that the steam room was mixed sex and the men had their scrub downs performed in this room on top of the heated slab.,0.4019
82,83,It’s not the most elegant of experiences so I was glad that ladies had a private room. In the centre of a room was a really hot marble raised area where you could sit or lie for extra heat. I chose to sit around the edge at one of the smaller areas. There were taps with little dishes where you could get cold water and throw it over yourself. After 30 minutes I was very warm and relieved when I was told it was my time for a scrub.,0.6772
83,84,I then went into a little side room and met an older lady. She asked me if I wanted her to wear clothes or not. I chose clothes and I could see she was a little disappointed.,-0.4228
84,85,The clothes were actually a bikini and I am glad I did choose that option otherwise there would have been some very awkward skin on skin contact!,0.3397
85,86,I was asked to lay on a slab which I did and then my towel was removed. I had taken my bra off as requested but left my knickers on.,0.0
86,87,She clearly wasn’t keen on my full M&S lace knickers so she hoiked them up giving me a very friendly but definite wedgie. It was an unnerving experience.,0.8221
87,88,"By now I was so far out of my comfort zone that I had started to see the funny side of the experience and I just let myself relax into it and not worry about what was going on. The scrub was amazing and whilst it wasn’t particularly relaxing, apart from the soap suds, I certainly felt clean by the end of it. The lady showed me how much stuff came off my skin and I have to say it was quite disgusting.",0.9546
88,89,After my scrub I headed upstairs for a lounger and waited for my oil massage. I was taken into a small room on the first floor where there was the obligatory CD of supposedly relaxing music playing.,0.6124
89,90,"However, there seemed to be a fault with the CD player and it just repeated the same track. After a couple of minutes I stopped noticing though as I was relaxed from having oil poured over me.",-0.1027
90,91,The massage was firm but not hard or sore and it felt nice to relax after a couple of busy days and such a bumpy start to my visit to Istanbul. I felt like I was experiencing something historic taking the Turkish bath.,0.9314
91,92,At the end of the bath I was given a face mask and told to apply it and then leave it on for a certain amount of time and then wash it off at a basin in a small corner room. Inbetween I laid on one of the loungers near the changing rooms and lockers and had a job to stay awake if I am honest.,0.6369
92,93,"Having washed up at the end I got changed and headed down the very tiny and steep stairs again and enjoyed a little cup of tea in the main entrance area. It was nice to see other guests coming in, mainly tourists, and the people who had been in the baths when I was there finished up also so it was a nice shared experience amongst strangers.",0.8834
93,94,Getting from Taksim Square to Sabiha Gokcen Airport Istanbul (Taksim Square) to Sabiha Gokcen Airport,0.0
94,95,"At the end of the visit I emerged back out onto the streets of Istanbul feeling that only on the last day I had found what I was looking for and feeling a little sad to be leaving. However, I had decided to check out of my hotel a night early and head for the Sabiha airport so I collected my things from my hotel room, checked out and then headed swiftly for my bus.",0.101
95,96,Having used the Havaist buses I decided to use them again to transfer from Taksim Square to Sabiha Gokcen airport.,0.0
96,97,Given I was staying close to Taksim Square it was an easy walk to the bus pickup. The lugagge was loaded and I was given a receipt and I then used my Istanbul Kart to pay for the fare.,0.3612
97,98,T he cost was 30 Turkish Lira (approximately £4). Again the bus was quite busy and it took about 1 hour and 30 minutes to reach the airport. As with the previous bus I wasn’t able to connect to the internet on the bus because it said I need a Turkish phone number. I preferred looking at the views anyway!,0.1759
98,99,I stayed at the ISG Airport Hotel for one night in early November 2019 as I was flying out the next day. I arrived on one of the transfer buses from Taksim Square which drops passengers at the upper level of the airport. I could see the hotel and thought I would walk but you cannot walk to the hotel from the airport.,0.0
99,100,To reach the hotel you need to go down to the ground floor and look for the sign for the hotel shuttle bus. It is located next to the gun loading point!,-0.3802

104,105,Is it safe to travel to Istanbul? Istanbul FAQs,0.4404
105,106,This is a great question and I have to say that this is one of the few places I have visited in the world where I have not felt comfortable walking around at night. I was approached by a number of men which I found quite intimidating.,-0.1268
106,107,Is Istanbul a good place to visit?,0.4404
107,108,As someone who likes to explore on foot it made exploring very difficult and it became more about dodging men than enjoying what I was looking at. I kept exploring during the hours of dusk to a minimum and felt this impacted on my stay.,0.4076
108,109,Istanbul had been one of the places I had dreamed about visiting and I have to say I was hugely disappointed. I should preface my comments by saying that I arrived in Istanbul totally exhausted having worked pretty much continuously for 2 months.,-0.4563
109,110,"I was then not able to get much sleep at the hotel in Istanbul which impacted on my ability to enjoy what I was doing. That said I was still disappointed. I found it extremely congested and busy which was OK but the constant beeping of horns was tiresome, the noise was relentless.",0.4527
110,111,I found it difficult to enjoy the visit because of the unwanted attention of men. I had wanted to visit the Grand Bazaar but decided I couldn’t face going in on my own after my experiences in the streets.,0.2263
111,112,"The main tram line down to the Blue Mosque area was extremely busy and crowded, so much so I decided to walk back to get the underground to Taksim. I also witnessed women being degraded and treated unfairly by men.",-0.4215
112,113,Do you need a visa to travel to Istanbul?,0.0
113,114,On the whole Istanbul was a lot more conservative and a lot less cosmopolitan than I expected it to be. I did however find a lovely cafe in a tiny street in the old part of Taksim and enjoyed a fabulous breakfast before I went to the oldest Hamman in the city and had the works. I also enjoyed having a cup of tea looking out over the Bosphorus and crossing it a couple of times on the ferry. I won’t be rushing to go back.,0.93
114,115,Istanbul Weather,0.0
115,116,Yes you do need a visa to visit Turkey but it is very easy to do via the evisa website. The official Turkish website is www.evisa.gov.tr and you can download the visa electronically too.

Please note there are different rules for passengers on cruise ships who may not need a visa depending on the length of the visit.,0.7422
116,117,I found the weather in Istanbul to be pleasant (however I do live in the North of Scotland so anything over 15 degrees Celsius is summer like!).,0.5562

125,126,How far is Sabiha airport from Istanbul city?,0.0
126,127,It is quite a long way — 54km officially. The airport site says it takes about 1 hour to reach the centre of Istanbul but it is probably wise to allow some time for congestion — Istanbul is a very congested city.,0.7615
