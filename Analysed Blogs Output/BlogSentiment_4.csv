0,1,"['Whether I’m taking planes, trains, and automobiles through Europe for six weeks or doing a quick couple of days in the Southwest, I don’t pack more than can fit in a carry-on suitcase and a backpack (or purse). I may check a bag, but the bag is still carry-on sized. As a single person, there’s no reason for me to bring more than this. Anything more is undoubtedly over packing, and ideally I’ll even have extra room in my suitcase to stow away some snacks or bring home a trinket or two.",0.418
1,2,"I have a few funny ways of accomplishing this, but it mostly comes down to good planning, the economy of clothes, and owning multi-purpose items. Here are a couple of methods that you may not have considered before.",0.7003
2,3,What’s up with special clothes for sleeping? Sleep in just a t-shirt and comfy bottoms that you could also wear while in transit or exercising. Or skip the bottoms altogether if you’re going somewhere warm.,0.5574
3,4,"Typically I end up needing two pairs of shoes, but it’s pretty cumbersome to bring more than three pairs. You have to forsake a bit of variety while traveling for the sake of functionality and the weight of your luggage. Wear your heaviest/biggest shoes (usually boots) while in transit, and only bring footwear that is of the utmost comfort and multi-purpose.",0.8201
4,5,"They’re teeny tiny shirts! Taking up little room in your suitcase is a hero feature of thin, small apparel. If it’s cold, they can be an extra layer over or under things, if it’s not, you’re nice and cool in miniature clothing. If they aren’t appropriate, disregard.",0.4137
5,6,"If you have a good pair of jeans you’ve solved half of your traveling problems. Jeans don’t get as dirty as people seem to think, so you won’t have to worry about washing them often. You really only need one or two pairs with you, regardless of the duration of your trip. If you’re wearing crop tops, it’s handy for one pair of jeans to be high wasted. Rigid or skin tight denim should be avoided, especially on heavy travel days, unless you’re brave enough to bear the discomfort.",-0.6908
6,7,"I like getting experimental and expressive with clothes every so often, but that’s really mood and weather contingent. When it comes to travel, you can’t really pack according to these whims. So in order to be economical with space, I recommend bringing practical, neutral items in a predetermined color palette. That way, items will be worn multiple times without much notice and without having to piece together a very specific “look” for an item. It’s also advisable to dress modestly and/or more formally in cities where you may be turned away because of a dress code.",0.296
7,8,"I bring a nude bra, a very flattering black racerback sports bra, and a swimsuit. This has worked very well for me, and can look good with a variety of different cuts of clothing. Clothes that are structured enough or loose enough to forgo upper body undergarments are excellent to pack. Keep in mind that your swimsuit (when dry, of course) is another set of undergarments, get creative!",0.8828
8,9,"Stowing so few items in your suitcase will likely mean that you’ll need to bring clothes that can be easily washed and dried, as well as the soap to do it. Liquid soap can be heavy and put you over airline limits. For this reason, I swear by bricks of laundry soap like Dr. Bronner’s Castile bar soap (affiliate link). You can cut just a portion for your trip and use it in tons of contexts. Synthetic fabrics and lace will dry the quickest, so don’t shy away from those for frequently worn items like socks and underwear.",0.4062
9,10,You’re now well on your way to thrive in a pretty broad variety of travel situations. Packing light liberates you from some of the most cumbersome aspects of traveling and frees you up to truly enjoy the places you. Bon voyage!'],0.9168
