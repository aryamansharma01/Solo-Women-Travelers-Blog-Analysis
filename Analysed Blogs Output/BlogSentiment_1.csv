1,2,"Edinburgh airport, mid-afternoon. As I arrive I receive an alert on my phone that my previous home is now the epicentre of a CoVid-19 outbreak in Scotland. I’m confident of my personal safety due to a year of living within my family bubble and already being an OCD-germaphobe with a germaphobe father, so I proceed onwards with sympathy towards the similarly rigorous people I am leaving behind.",0.8225
2,3,"Seeing off my suitcase adorned with a sticker of Min Yoongi pouting sadly, weighing in at 23.5kg. The limit was 23kg but the kind lady kept it hush-hush and simply wrote 23kg… Thank-you, kind lady! Then, seeing my father off as reassuringly as I can, I ascend the escalator towards security. The process here doesn’t seem to have changed, save for more hand-sanitising stations and far less people. I would traverse long corridors without hearing any kind of indication of another human. I progress through and wait for my gate to be announced, treating every living being I see and every surface as if infected by the virus. It really doesn’t feel different from **the precedented times**.",0.9778
3,4,"As I sit munching on my vegan BBQ Chick’n Panini from Costa behind my KF-94 mask, I am messaging my friend, another recent Borders escapee. We spoke about our appreciation for the countryside, but our love of cities, in spite of all their flaws. Countryside towns and suburban areas tend to give you a ready-made community and, despite the sparser population density, it would be harder to slip through the cracks into isolation or hardships like you might in a city. Fresh air and nature are so rejuvenating and bring so much clarity. But, in spite of it all, at least at this point in my life, nothing hits the same for me as a city skyline or nighttime street. I can zoom out from myself and imagine overlooking the whole city, and feel oddly warm and connected to every single person living out their lives within it. Nothing turns me into a glowing ball of gratitude and appreciation quite like this feeling of connection to humanity. I know the downsides of the anonymity, but I feel oddly safe and satisfied. The little encounters with strangers that stick with you forever or even just brighten your day a little, those are what keep me going most easily, and I just find them harder to come by in ready-made communities. In fairness, though, this is likely because in rural areas, I generally participate in life less, for whatever reason. Perhaps with things being less accessible (read: not within walking distance) and new activities and people being more expensive.",0.9901
4,5,"[My friend agreed that these experiences were few and far between for her in the Borders, especially being brown, and recounted an experience the other week where her (Indian) father was approached and asked what tribe he is from… Whilst horrifyingly hilarious, not quite the rejuvenating interactions with strangers I’m looking for!]",0.4574
5,6,"I realise it might sound like rose-tinted spectacles, or a grass-is-greener situation, especially to those who disagree, but I don’t believe this is the case. I’ve been poor, cold, hungry. In Glasgow. In Tokyo. My first few months in Seoul won’t be easy. But those circumstances didn’t make me unhappy. In fact, having zilch but being in Tokyo was when I was at the peak of inner peace and appreciation. I don’t intend to live like that forever, but I definitely feel very strongly that I want to experience a lot whilst I build up my life. I feel like as long as I am doing *things*, it’s very hard to feel any regret, and I have the utmost faith that it will work out for me one day. Or that at any point I can just hop off the travelator and pursue normalcy or whatever if it gets to be too much…",0.9589

7,8,"Even the parts of this process that are usually fairly grim, like waiting around in chairs with little-to-no back support, or rag-dolling over your suitcase for some momentary groggy rest, I found myself… kinda loving them. Partially because of it being an investment, a step towards building the next chapter of my life. But also partially just because it’s something different from the groundhog day-year that was 2020.",0.6258

I pass the check, am made to sign a general health and symptoms check and have it approved, then I am told my gate number and can proceed. It’s in this waiting area where I start encountering Korean language spoken **in the wild** by staff members, and I discovered an incredible annoying trait of mine that will carry through all the airport experiences to come. If someone is speaking in Korean near me, and then approaches me, I will subconsciously respond with basic Korean affirmations and such //in tiny//. Barely audible, under my mask, but it is enough to trigger *their* subconscious into speaking to me about complicated airport-y things in Korean where they otherwise would have spoken English. I would continue to carry this embarrassing and awkward habit with me right to my self-quarantine accommodation. Great!",0.3054
10,11,"Board the plane happily after having my details, including my negative PCR test from the Edinburgh airport drive-through two days prior, reviewed by the staff. I am very happy to find that, for my 11hr flight, my area of the plane is completely empty. In fact, the very second I sit down in my assigned row, a member of staff calls “Miss Turner-Gibb? You’re having a special vegan meal, right?”. No social distancing worries here, at least! Very reassuring. I was able to build a sort of hazmat suit-bed out of my possessions and the complimentary disposable blankets. By putting the arm rests up, I was able to lie down completely in my invention and slept pretty well. My mask did get pretty irritating on the flight, but when I swapped it out for a fresh one over a mealtime, it was relieving. Sanitising wipes and gel were provided with every meal/snacktime, and the vegan options ranged from something akin to baby food to actual nutritious vegan snacks, especially the morning ‘hot savoury snack’ that was like a rye pastry sausage roll made with jackfruit and chickpeas. Vegan stroopwafels were also provided, much to my delight!",0.9709

12,13,"I wanna preface this by saying how happy I am to go through all kinds of safety measures upon arriving in a country. The individualistic approach of the United Kingdom has never sat right with me. I prefer a strong sense of community/responsibility to community, and I’m feeling that more strongly here. Even though going through the process with citizens from danger areas like the U.K and the U.S, and waiting for hours in those areas, might technically put someone safe and negative like myself more at risk of catching the virus than if I proceeded through normally, I don’t mind because I know how much safer it makes it for the wider community, for reasonable resources! Not to mention that I will benefit from this when emerging from the other side!",0.9601
13,14,"So, arrivals. We queue up, with signs telling all Korean nationals and foreign long term residents to install the self quarantine app. We have our temperature check, and mine is a little high. Maybe because I opted to wear all my heaviest clothes for luggage purposes… I am escorted to a different cordoned off area to wait for 10 minutes sitting down before getting a secondary temperature check. It’s below the fever mark but still warm. The quarantine officer asks me if I suffer from claustrophobia or panic disorder. Despite my immediate internal panic at the question (lol), I say no. I do some paperwork, and am escorted to *another* cordoned-off area. I do some *more* paperwork, and then am escorted to a single plastic chair outside of the airport behind a van to get my coronavirus swab test. It’s over in a flash, and I’m taken to a cubicle with a single plastic chair in the middle. It’s at this point I sneak a selfie in my newfound privacy.",-0.962

16,17,"We are all escorted from our cubicles from the full PPE officer from before, to a desk. The woman at the desk allows everyone to pass. The two English guys get bounced back. I am last. She bounces me back without looking at my PCR test and sends me to the PPE officers, who send me back to her immediately. The woman at the desk clarifies “So, Scotland, England, England?” pointing to the three of us individually. She allows me to pass, not them. One of the English lads calls out “Oh, so it’s a Scotland/England thing now, is it?”. I turn back, and give a wry “It always was”, before passing through the barrier smugly…', ""Turns out we had to wait for them with the rest of the group on the other side anyway. We all collect our baggage, and are taken outside and onto an airport bus to the Incheon Airport Quarantine Facility about 15 minutes away. There is no heating on the bus, and the temperature is about -15'C at this point. I am wriggling my fingers and toes with vigour, non-stop, the entire route, but they still go numb and then painful in the fingertips. The English lads from earlier said this was their second time quarantining in South Korea, and last time they accidentally ended up getting lumped in with the U.S Army group and were escorted to a base with them… We are all taken inside the facility inside individually and given a new cubicle to sit in. It’s about 18.30."", '10 minutes pass, when I hear an American girl on the phone saying she tested positive for CoVid-19. I already have the two strap 3M KF-95 mask they provided me with after my initial temperature check, but I wrap my scarf around my face and slide into my chair, a little nervous upon hearing this. She phones her father and is clearly panicking saying it’s her first time in Korea, that she had the virus already on December 15th, asking where she goes after hospital and such. I don’t know where she flew from, but her airline must have let her fly here to South Korea without a proper negative test?? Sigh.",-0.5305
17,18,"I begin to get realistic with myself about the likelihood of me catching it entirely airbourne through several cubicles with my mask on, and accepting that even if I get unlucky, I took all the measures I could regarding contact with surfaces and the like. She is escorted away and the staff spend about 2hrs sanitising (our meal is delayed due to this — fine by me)!",0.6696
18,19,"Our food box arrives a little after 8.40pm. I was already quite dehydrated at this point but had been too worried about removing my mask to remedy this. At this point, I decide to bite the bullet and eat some of the rice, kimchi, and veg, and downing my water before refitting the mask! Thanks to the openness of freelance journalist based in South Korea, Raphael Rashid, I knew that this happened to him as well as he also flew from the U.K. He chatted to me during my time in the quarantine facility and was very pragmatic and reassuring, and I’m grateful for it! Hopefully get to thank him with Seoul food post-quarantine. Raphael’s group had received their test results about 2am, but some of them (including himself — he wonders if this is due to him coming from England) had their swabs reexamined to be sure, and had to stay in the facility overnight in pressurised rooms.",0.9804

20,21,"I was expecting much the same for myself, so I was pleasantly surprised when at 23.20, my facility officer came and told me my results were negative, and in 20 minutes we would go back to Incheon Airport, terminal 1, and I could then arrange transport to my home in Itaewon, where I will quarantine for two weeks! Back on to the freezing airport bus. Our breath now visible from the cold, I can see that when we exhale, our breath goes directly upwards. So we all sit in our individual rows, puffing like chimneys for the final stretch. At this point, I am the only non-Korean speaking member of the group. I approach one of the officers escorting us telling him that I reserved a 30-day unlimited data SIM card to be collected within the airport. He begins escorting me to the SIM card desk, although admits that he isn’t sure if it will be open (it’s a little after midnight now). When it appears in his vision (but not mine because I am painfully short-sighted and not wearing my glasses because the only thing worse than short-sighted vision is steamed glasses from mask), he cheers for me and it is indeed open! I collect my SIM, and the man makes me install it there and then to check it works. I am grateful for his being thorough, but I wish I had changed my phone background/screensaver from my favourite idol before it being revealed to the desk staff, the officer, and the queue behind me…",0.7879
21,22,"The officer escorts me back to the taxi rank. He points at something and inquires “So, who is that?”. I follow his finger to find it is pointing at the sticker on my suitcase, and I simply laugh, embarrassed. He admits that he knows it is Min Yoongi of BTS. We converse a little, and when he abruptly has to leave me at the Taxi desk, he gives a very genuine goodbye.

We struggle to communicate in either Korean or English, he slaps a red dot on my arm and allows me to sit down and wait for a taxi. I feel several eyes on me as I sit down, for the first time in the entire journey — still not sure why! The second I sit down, the smiley girl next to me turns to me and asks if I’m going to Seoul, etc. We swap life-timelines. She studied early childcare in Canada and now works in the sector, but she is off work on paid holiday for 3 months. She wants to visit Edinburgh. I promise to give her a tour someday. She also refers to the Yoongi sticker on my suitcase, and asks who my bias is. “Ahh, actually it is Jin… What about you?” “Actually, the same.” We laugh, before she admits “I noticed your RJ backpack as you walked in and wanted to talk to you.” A Seokjinnie, in the wild! She is taken away to a Seoul-bound taxi before we can trade kkt IDs. Godspeed, Incheon Seokjinnie! I hope you get to Edinburgh some day, after all this madness.",0.9145
23,24,"Then my ajeossi taxi driver arrives like a ton of bricks. Ushering me from place to place like a man on a mission. Time is of the money or whatever the phrase is. I had referenced to friends before about the type of Seoul taxi driver I want to take me across the bridge, and I got it. The smell of cigarettes, the intense multi-tasking on the highway, putting seatbelt on when already half way to Seoul. He added me on WhatsApp and kept telling me just to call him instead of fussing around with other taxis… and that he was a tour guide in Western Europe between ’95 and ’97, so if I want to go sight-seeing around Seoul after quarantine, etc… He showed me the health centre I will need to visit, and how close it is to my apartment. We spent the entire journey in a special separated quarantine taxi, only for him to hug me at the end of it…",0.93

Still a very bad kind. So bad, in fact, that upon seeing all the stairs from the parking lot to my apartment with no elevator, and looking at my 23.5kg suitcase, and it being 2am, I actually made the risky decision to leave my luggage in the parking lot lobby and lie down first… SORRY, DAD.

25,26,"The underfloor heating had been on in the apartment all day. You’d think with the freezing numbness from earlier, I’d be happy about this, but in my fragile state, it was not good. I turned off the heating, turned on the aircon, and opened the window before starfishing on top of the bedding after a cold shower. When I awoke, I immediately popped out with my backpack, opened up the suitcase, and took everything up in 4 separate trips. I then checked the time and realised my 30 minute nap was actually 5–6hrs and it was early morning. Oops. Oh, well. No harm, no foul…",-0.8405

I turned the TV onto SBS Plus, unpacked, and began my day like any other. Showering, skincare routine, breakfast, multivitamin, unpacking, etc. In my whole time in U.K and beyond, I have experienced the ‘emergency alerts to all phones’ system about three times. However, I am getting texts almost hourly! Some have been about temperature drops, with advice on preventing pipes from freezing. Some have been CoVid-19 cases per area, and about the initiation of epidemiological investigations and such. One spoke about when to take your mask off in a restaurant, but warned that you will be immediately at risk when you do, etc. All in all, I feel much more safe and aware here, and am very happy. I will enjoy quarantine as a forced time to prepare and settle in. It will still be daunting to be back in civilisation, but at least the process is being made as best as it can be, and for that I am grateful. And hungry. I’m hungry. I think I need to order food.
